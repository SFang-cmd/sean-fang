## Demo Script & Timestamps

### ðŸŽ¬ **00:00â€“00:30** â€” Introduction & System Overview

**Script:**
> "Hi! I'm demonstrating the SAT Agentic AI Tutor - an intelligent tutoring system that uses agentic AI to provide step-by-step SAT preparation. The system features a sophisticated agent architecture with planning, tool execution, and memory, plus an advanced knowledge management system with semantic search."

**Screen Actions:**
- Show the main Streamlit interface with two tabs
- Briefly highlight the knowledge base structure (78 organized files)
- Point out the dual functionality: Problem Solver + Knowledge Q&A

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Agentic architecture with Gemini AI integration
- Comprehensive SAT knowledge base with ChromaDB embeddings
- Real-time problem solving with step-by-step explanations

### ðŸ§  **00:30â€“01:30** â€” User Input â†’ Agentic Planning

**Script:**
> "Let me show you the agentic planning in action. I'll input a SAT math problem and you'll see how the system analyzes the query, classifies the problem type, and creates a structured solution plan using the ReAct pattern."

**Demo Scenario:**
- **Tab 1: Problem Solver**
- **Input**: "Solve for x: 2(x + 3) = 4x - 8"
- **Show**: Real-time planning process

**Screen Actions:**
1. Type the linear equation problem
2. Show the planning phase with step-by-step reasoning
3. Highlight the ReAct pattern: Thought â†’ Action â†’ Observation â†’ Reflection
4. Display the structured plan with multiple steps

**Agentic Elements to Highlight:**
- **Problem Classification**: "Linear equation with distribution"
- **Strategy Selection**: "Use inverse operations methodology"
- **Tool Planning**: "Will need knowledge search + calculations"
- **Step Sequencing**: "Distribute â†’ Combine â†’ Isolate â†’ Verify"

### ðŸ”§ **01:30â€“02:30** â€” Tool Calls & Knowledge Retrieval

**Script:**
> "Now watch the executor in action as it follows the plan, calling specialized tools and retrieving relevant knowledge. The system uses semantic search to find the most relevant SAT strategies from our knowledge base."

**Screen Actions:**
1. Show tool execution in real-time
2. Demonstrate knowledge retrieval with highlighted relevant content
3. Display calculation steps with explanations
4. Show memory updates and context preservation

**Tool Demonstrations:**
- **search_knowledge()**: Query "linear equations with distribution"
  - Show semantic search results from knowledge base
  - Highlight relevant strategies retrieved
- **calculate()**: Step-by-step mathematical operations
  - Show "2(x + 3)" â†’ "2x + 6"
  - Show "2x + 6 = 4x - 8" â†’ "14 = 2x" â†’ "x = 7"
- **verify_solution()**: Substitute back to check
  - Show "2(7 + 3) = 4(7) - 8" â†’ "20 = 20 âœ“"

**Memory Integration:**
- Show conversation history being updated
- Display context preservation for future queries
- Highlight learning progress tracking

### ðŸ“Š **02:30â€“03:30** â€” Final Output & Knowledge Management

**Script:**
> "The system provides a comprehensive solution with explanations. Now let me show the knowledge management capabilities and demonstrate how the system handles different types of queries, including edge cases."

**Screen Actions:**
1. Show complete solution with step-by-step explanations
2. Switch to **Tab 2: Knowledge Q&A** 
3. Demonstrate semantic search with: "How do I identify supporting evidence in reading passages?"
4. Show knowledge editor functionality
5. Demonstrate error handling

**Knowledge Q&A Demo:**
- **Input**: "What strategies help with command of evidence questions?"
- **Show**: Semantic search retrieving relevant English content
- **Display**: Comprehensive guidance with examples and strategies

**Knowledge Editor Demo:**
- Navigate to knowledge files by subject/domain/skill
- Show file editing with live preview
- Demonstrate save functionality with automatic embedding updates

**Edge Case Handling:**
- Show response to ambiguous query: "Help me with math"
- Demonstrate graceful handling of out-of-scope questions
- Show memory persistence across different question types

**Final Highlights:**
- **Dual Interface**: Problem solving + Knowledge management
- **Agentic Architecture**: Planning â†’ Execution â†’ Memory â†’ Response
- **Advanced RAG**: Semantic search across 78 SAT knowledge files
- **Gemini Integration**: Planning with 2.0 Flash + Embeddings with text-embedding-004
