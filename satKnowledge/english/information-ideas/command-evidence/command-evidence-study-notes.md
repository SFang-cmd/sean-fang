# Command of Evidence Study Notes

## Key Concepts

- **Definition**: Command of Evidence questions ask you to identify specific lines from a passage that best support a given answer or claim
- **Question Types**: "Which choice provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question?" or "Which lines best support the idea that..."
- **Two-part structure**: Often paired with analysis questions - first you answer interpretation, then find supporting evidence
- **Reading comprehension focus**: Tests your ability to locate textual support for inferences and conclusions

## Common Question Indicators

- "Which choice provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question?"
- "Which lines from the passage most strongly support the idea that..."
- "The author's claim is best supported by which of the following quotations?"
- "Which quotation from the passage best illustrates..."
- "Which excerpt most clearly demonstrates..."

## Strategies and Rules

- **Read the previous question first**: Evidence questions are usually paired with interpretation questions
- **Look for direct support**: The evidence should directly relate to the claim, not just mention the topic
- **Avoid partial matches**: Don't choose evidence that only supports part of the answer
- **Consider scope**: Make sure the evidence supports the full scope of the claim
- **Eliminate weak connections**: Evidence should be strong and clear, not vague or tangential

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Choosing topic-related but not claim-supporting evidence**: Just because text mentions the same topic doesn't mean it supports the specific claim
- **Selecting evidence for the wrong question**: Make sure you're supporting the right interpretation
- **Picking evidence that's too narrow or too broad**: Match the scope of the evidence to the scope of the claim
- **Ignoring the relationship between paired questions**: The evidence must support your answer to the previous question

## Practice Tips

- **Work backwards**: Start with your answer to the interpretation question, then find evidence that supports it
- **Use elimination**: Cross out evidence that clearly doesn't support your interpretation
- **Look for key words**: Evidence often contains synonyms or paraphrases of key terms from the correct answer
- **Practice paired questions together**: Don't separate the interpretation and evidence questions
- **Check your logic**: Ask yourself "Does this evidence actually prove this claim?"

## Example Question Pattern

**Question 1**: The author suggests that renewable energy adoption has been...
A) Slower than expected due to cost concerns
B) Rapid despite technological challenges  
C) Inconsistent across different regions
D) Successful beyond initial projections

**Question 2**: Which choice provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question?
A) Lines 12-14 ("Despite initial optimism...")
B) Lines 23-25 ("The cost of solar panels...")  
C) Lines 31-33 ("Regional differences in policy...")
D) Lines 45-47 ("Adoption rates have exceeded...")

## Study Strategy
1. Practice identifying claim-evidence relationships in everyday reading
2. Work through paired question sets methodically
3. Focus on precision - evidence must be specific and direct
4. Time yourself to build speed and accuracy
