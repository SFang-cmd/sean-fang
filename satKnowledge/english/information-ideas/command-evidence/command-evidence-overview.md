# Command of Evidence Overview

## What are Command of Evidence Questions?

Command of Evidence questions are a specific type of SAT Reading question that test your ability to identify textual evidence that supports a particular claim, interpretation, or answer. These questions are designed to assess whether you can locate specific lines or passages that best justify or support a conclusion you've drawn from the text.

### 1. Paired Questions

### 2. Standalone Evidence Questions
