# Area & Volume Overview

## Introduction

Area and volume calculations are fundamental geometric concepts frequently tested on the SAT. These problems test your ability to apply formulas, visualize 3D shapes, and solve multi-step geometric problems involving measurements.

## Key Concepts

### Area (2D Shapes)
Area measures the space inside a flat (2-dimensional) shape, expressed in square units.

### Volume (3D Shapes)
Volume measures the space inside a solid (3-dimensional) shape, expressed in cubic units.

## Essential Formulas

### 2D Shapes - Area

#### Rectangles and Squares
- **Rectangle**: A = length × width = lw
- **Square**: A = side² = s²

#### Triangles
- **Basic formula**: A = ½ × base × height = ½bh
- **Right triangle**: A = ½ × leg₁ × leg₂
- **Using Heron's formula**: For sides a, b, c: A = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], where s = (a+b+c)/2

#### Circles
- **Area**: A = πr² (where r = radius)
- **Circumference**: C = 2πr = πd (where d = diameter)

#### Parallelograms and Trapezoids
- **Parallelogram**: A = base × height = bh
- **Trapezoid**: A = ½(b₁ + b₂)h (where b₁, b₂ are parallel bases)

### 3D Shapes - Volume

#### Rectangular Prisms and Cubes
- **Rectangular prism**: V = length × width × height = lwh
- **Cube**: V = side³ = s³

#### Cylinders
- **Volume**: V = πr²h (where r = radius, h = height)
- **Surface area**: SA = 2πr² + 2πrh

#### Spheres
- **Volume**: V = (4/3)πr³
- **Surface area**: SA = 4πr²

#### Cones and Pyramids
- **Cone**: V = (1/3)πr²h
- **Pyramid**: V = (1/3) × base area × height

## Common SAT Question Types

### Type 1: Direct Formula Application
**Example**: A rectangle has length 12 cm and width 8 cm. What is its area?
- A = lw = 12 × 8 = 96 cm²

### Type 2: Finding Missing Dimensions
**Example**: A rectangle has area 72 cm² and width 6 cm. What is its length?
- A = lw → 72 = l × 6 → l = 72/6 = 12 cm

### Type 3: Composite Shapes
**Example**: Find the area of a shape made from a rectangle with a semicircle attached.
- Calculate each part separately, then add/subtract as appropriate

### Type 4: Scale Factor Problems
**Example**: If all dimensions of a shape are doubled, how does the area change?
- Area scales by the square of the scale factor (2² = 4 times larger)

### Type 5: Word Problems
**Example**: A cylindrical water tank has radius 3 feet and height 10 feet. How many cubic feet of water can it hold?
- V = πr²h = π(3)²(10) = 90π cubic feet

## Key Strategies

### 1. Identify the Shape
- Draw a diagram if not provided
- Label known measurements
- Identify what you're solving for

### 2. Choose the Right Formula
- Area for 2D shapes (square units)
- Volume for 3D shapes (cubic units)
- Surface area for outer covering (square units)

### 3. Watch Your Units
- Keep units consistent throughout calculations
- Convert units if necessary (feet to inches, etc.)
- Include proper units in your final answer

### 4. Break Down Complex Shapes
- Divide composite shapes into simpler parts
- Add areas for shapes placed side by side
- Subtract areas for shapes with holes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Confusing area and perimeter**: Area is inside space, perimeter is boundary length
2. **Unit errors**: Mixing different units or forgetting to convert
3. **Formula confusion**: Using diameter instead of radius in circle formulas
4. **3D vs 2D**: Confusing volume with surface area
5. **Scale factor errors**: Forgetting that area scales by the square of the linear scale factor

## SAT-Specific Tips

### Strategy Tips
- **Estimate when possible**: Use π ≈ 3 for quick approximations
- **Look for special relationships**: 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 triangles
- **Check answer choices**: Sometimes you can work backwards
- **Draw diagrams**: Visualization helps with complex problems

### Time Management
- Simple formula problems: 1-2 minutes
- Multi-step problems: 2-3 minutes
- Complex composite shapes: 3-4 minutes

### Calculator Use
- Use calculator for π calculations
- Store intermediate results to avoid rounding errors
- Double-check formula inputs

## Real-World Applications

Understanding area and volume helps with:
- **Architecture**: Room planning, material calculations
- **Engineering**: Container design, fluid calculations
- **Art and Design**: Canvas sizing, sculptural proportions
- **Daily Life**: Gardening plots, storage optimization
