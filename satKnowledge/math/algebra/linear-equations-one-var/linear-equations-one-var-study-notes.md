# Linear Equations in One Variable Study Notes

## Key Concepts

- **Definition**: A linear equation in one variable has the form ax + b = c, where a ≠ 0
- **Goal**: Isolate the variable (usually x) on one side of the equation
- **Balance principle**: Whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other side
- **Solution**: The value of the variable that makes the equation true

## Formulas and Rules

- **Standard form**: ax + b = c
- **Solution formula**: x = (c - b)/a
- **Inverse operations**: Use addition/subtraction and multiplication/division to isolate x
- **Order of operations**: Reverse PEMDAS when solving (start with addition/subtraction, then multiplication/division)

## Common SAT Question Types

- **Basic solving**: "If 3x + 7 = 22, what is the value of x?"
- **Multi-step equations**: "If 2(x - 3) + 5 = 13, what is x?"
- **Equations with fractions**: "If (x + 4)/3 = 7, what is x?"
- **Word problems**: "Sarah has 3 more than twice the number of books John has. If Sarah has 19 books, how many does John have?"

## Step-by-Step Solution Process

1. **Simplify both sides** (distribute, combine like terms)
2. **Move variable terms to one side** (add/subtract)
3. **Move constant terms to the other side** (add/subtract)
4. **Divide by the coefficient** of the variable
5. **Check your answer** by substituting back

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Sign errors**: Be careful with negative signs when moving terms
- **Distribution mistakes**: Don't forget to distribute to all terms inside parentheses
- **Fraction errors**: When dividing by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal
- **Not checking answers**: Always substitute your solution back into the original equation

## Practice Tips

- **Work systematically**: Follow the same steps every time
- **Show all work**: Don't skip steps, especially on the SAT
- **Use inverse operations**: Think about "undoing" what's been done to the variable
- **Practice with fractions and decimals**: Don't just stick to whole numbers
- **Time yourself**: Build speed while maintaining accuracy

## Example Problems

### Example 1: Basic Linear Equation
**Problem**: If 3x + 7 = 22, what is the value of x?

**Solution**:
1. 3x + 7 = 22
2. 3x = 22 - 7 (subtract 7 from both sides)
3. 3x = 15
4. x = 15/3 (divide both sides by 3)
5. x = 5

**Check**: 3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22 ✓

### Example 2: Multi-step with Distribution
**Problem**: If 2(x - 3) + 5 = 13, what is x?

**Solution**:
1. 2(x - 3) + 5 = 13
2. 2x - 6 + 5 = 13 (distribute the 2)
3. 2x - 1 = 13 (combine like terms)
4. 2x = 13 + 1 (add 1 to both sides)
5. 2x = 14
6. x = 7 (divide both sides by 2)

**Check**: 2(7 - 3) + 5 = 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 ✓

## SAT-Specific Tips

- **Look for shortcuts**: Sometimes you can work backwards from answer choices
- **Be careful with word problems**: Translate carefully from English to math
- **Watch for "tricky" setups**: Make sure you're solving for the right variable
- **Use estimation**: Check if your answer makes sense in context
