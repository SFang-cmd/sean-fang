# Linear Equations in One Variable Overview

## Introduction

Linear equations in one variable are fundamental algebraic expressions where the variable appears to the first power only. These equations form the foundation for more advanced algebraic concepts and are frequently tested on the SAT.

A linear equation in one variable has the general form: **ax + b = c**, where:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants
- `x` is the variable
- `a â‰  0` (otherwise it wouldn't be linear)

## Key Concepts

### Standard Form
The most common forms you'll encounter:
- **ax + b = c** (basic form)
- **ax = b** (simplified form)
- **x = c** (solved form)

### Solution Process
1. **Isolate the variable** by performing inverse operations
2. **Maintain equality** by doing the same operation to both sides
3. **Simplify** to get x = [some number]

## Common SAT Question Types

### Type 1: Direct Solving
**Example**: Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 22
- Subtract 7: 3x = 15
- Divide by 3: x = 5

### Type 2: Variables on Both Sides
**Example**: Solve for x: 4x - 3 = 2x + 9
- Subtract 2x: 2x - 3 = 9
- Add 3: 2x = 12
- Divide by 2: x = 6

### Type 3: Distributive Property
**Example**: Solve for x: 2(x + 4) = 3x - 1
- Distribute: 2x + 8 = 3x - 1
- Subtract 2x: 8 = x - 1
- Add 1: x = 9

## Key Strategies

### 1. Work Systematically
- Combine like terms
- Eliminate fractions by multiplying by LCD
- Use distributive property when needed

### 2. Check Your Answer
Always substitute back into the original equation to verify your solution.

### 3. Watch for Special Cases
- **No solution**: Contradictions like 0 = 5
- **Infinite solutions**: Identities like 3 = 3

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Sign errors**: Be careful with negative signs when moving terms
2. **Distributive errors**: Don't forget to multiply ALL terms inside parentheses
3. **Fraction mistakes**: Clear denominators early to avoid errors
4. **Not checking work**: Always verify your answer

## SAT Tips

- These problems often appear early in the math section
- Look for opportunities to use mental math
- If given multiple choice, you can work backwards from answers
- Time allocation: Should solve these quickly (1-2 minutes max)

## Practice Problem Types

1. **Basic isolation**: 2x + 5 = 13
2. **Variables both sides**: 5x - 2 = 3x + 8
3. **With fractions**: (x/3) + 2 = 7
4. **With parentheses**: 4(x - 1) = 2x + 6
5. **Word problems**: Age, money, or measurement scenarios
